/**
 * @class Browse
 * @brief Represents a customer browsing plants in the nursery
 *
 * The Browse class is a concrete state in the State pattern, representing
 * a customer looking at plants. It uses Qt's QTimer for simulating asynchronous
 * browsing time before transitioning to the next state (Enquire, Purchasing, or leaving).
 *
 * Features:
 * - Asynchronous browsing with timer-based state transitions
 * - Manages list of plants customer is interested in
 * - Supports random decoration selection for plants
 * - Transitions to Enquire, Purchasing, or Browse states
 *
 * @note Inherits from QObject for Qt signal/slot mechanism
