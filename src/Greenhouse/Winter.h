 * hierarchy. It defines winter-specific behavior including seasonal
 * transitions and inventory adjustments for winter conditions.

 * @design
 * Implements the Seasons interface as part of the State pattern.
 * Handles transitions from winter to the next season (spring)
 * and executes winter-specific commands through the WinterCommand class.
 * Completes the seasonal cycle by transitioning back to spring.
 * 
 * @note This class follows the typical winter seasonal characteristics:
 *       - Dormant season for most plants
 *       - Low or zero stock of frost-sensitive plants
 *       - Plants in dormant or dead stages
 *       - Executes WinterCommand during construction
