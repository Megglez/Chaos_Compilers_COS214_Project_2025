/**
 * @brief Executes the add stock command
 * @param plant R-value reference to the plant to be added to inventory
 * @param quantity The number of plants to add to inventory
 * 
 * This method transfers ownership of the plant object to the inventory
 * by moving the unique_ptr. The inventory then adds the specified
 * quantity of this plant type to its stock.
 * 
 * @note After execution, the original plant unique_ptr will be empty
 *       due to the move operation. The inventory now owns the plant object.
 * 
 * @par Example:
 * @code
 * auto plant = std::make_unique<Plant>("Rose", "flower");
 * AddStock addCommand(&inventory);
 * addCommand.execute(std::move(plant), 10);  // Adds 10 rose plants
 * // 'plant' is now empty after move
 * @endcode
 * 
 * @see Inventory::addPlant
