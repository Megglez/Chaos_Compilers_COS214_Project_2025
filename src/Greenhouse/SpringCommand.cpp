 * @brief Executes the spring seasonal transition

 * - Stock level adjustments for new growing season
 * - Plant development stage updates from dormant to growing
 * - Staff notifications about seasonal change

 * @par Spring Transition Effects:
 * Based on previous inventory logic, this typically applies:
 * - Succulents: 25 (low stock - still risky after winter)
 * - Herbs: 80 (good stock - beginning to grow)
 * - Flowers: 90 (high stock - spring blooms)
 * - Trees: 100 (high stock - prime planting time)
 * - Plant stages transition from "Dead" to "Seed" or "Sapling"
 * 
 * @remark This command completes the annual cycle: Winter â†’ Spring
 *         and begins the new growing season for all plants.
