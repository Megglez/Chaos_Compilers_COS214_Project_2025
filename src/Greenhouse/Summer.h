 * Implements the Seasons interface as part of the State pattern.
 * Handles transitions from summer to the next season (autumn)

 *       - Peak growing season for most plants
 *       - High stock of succulents, herbs, and flowers
 *       - Plants in prime development stage
 *       - Executes SummerCommand during construction
