 * The Spring class represents the spring season in the State pattern
 * hierarchy. It defines spring-specific behavior including seasonal
 * transitions and inventory adjustments for spring conditions.

 * @design
 * Implements the Seasons interface as part of the State pattern.
 * Handles transitions from spring to the next season (summer)
 * and executes spring-specific commands through the SpringCommand class.

 * @note This class follows the typical spring seasonal characteristics:
 *       - Planting and growth season begins
 *       - High stock of flowers, herbs, and trees
 *       - Plants transition from dormant to growing stages
 *       - Executes SpringCommand during construction
