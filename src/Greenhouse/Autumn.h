 * hierarchy. It defines autumn-specific behavior including seasonal

 * @design
 * Implements the Seasons interface as part of the State pattern.
 * Handles transitions from autumn to the next season (typically winter)
 * and executes autumn-specific commands through the AutumnCommand class.

 *       - Plants begin to wilt and die back
 *       - Trees are prime for planting
 *       - Summer plants are phased out
 *       - Executes AutumnCommand during construction
